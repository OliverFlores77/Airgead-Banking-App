# Airgead-Banking-App
1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving

This project was about creating a simple banking program for a fictional company called Airgead Banking. The purpose was to help users, especially students, understand how their investments can grow over time. The program takes input like the initial investment, monthly deposit, interest rate, and number of years, then shows how the balance and interest grow with and without monthly deposits. It helps show how compound interest works and why investing regularly can make a big difference.

2. What did you do particularly well?

I think I did a good job following the instructions and keeping my code organized. I split everything into the right files — one for the class, one for the header, and one for the main program. I also made sure to use clear variable names and wrote comments to help explain what each part of the code does. The output looks clean and is easy to understand when you run the program.

3. Where could you enhance your code?

If I had more time, I would improve the way the program handles bad input. Right now, it only checks if the numbers are above a certain value, but it doesn’t handle things like letters or symbols very well. Adding more error checking would make the program more user-friendly and prevent crashes. I also think it would be cool to let the user choose how often interest is compounded, like monthly or quarterly.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?

The hardest part for me was figuring out how to calculate interest both with and without the monthly deposit. It took me a little time to understand the order — like when to add the deposit and when to apply the interest. I used small test examples to make sure it was calculating correctly, and once I got one loop working, the rest came together more easily.

5. What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

For this project, I mainly used the code and instructions the instructor gave us. Those examples helped me understand how to structure the program and what each part needed to do. I also looked at my past notes and some basic C++ tutorials when I wasn’t sure how to do something. I’ll definitely keep using clear class examples and step-by-step breakdowns when working on future projects.

6. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

This project helped me get more comfortable using classes and object-oriented programming. I also got better at writing functions and keeping my code clean and organized. These are things I know I’ll need in future programming classes and even real jobs. It also taught me to slow down and plan things out before jumping into the code.

7. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I used simple naming for my variables and functions so it’s easy to understand what they do. I also split up my code into three files to keep everything organized, and I added comments so someone else reading the code would know what’s going on. If I needed to make changes later, like adjusting how interest works or adding more features, I think it would be pretty easy to update without starting over.
